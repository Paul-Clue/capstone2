# HTML Capstone Project
The purpose of this project is to revisit all of the concepts that I learned in the HTML course. The project requires that I clone a professional website. I must also add my own personal touches to the clone. I must change the business and branding. The website must be composed of three pages that are all linked through the index.html page. The three pages that I cloned are the landing page, the about page, and the ticket page.

- The landing page showcases all of what the business has to offer its customers.
- The about page offers some information about the company itself and the people who work for it.
- The ticket page gives an example of what how the business business handles ticket orders and meal requests.
